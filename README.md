# coffeemaker
A DIY IoT Coffeemaker

The idea was to get a Raspberry Pi, some sensors, pumps, motors and other equipment to make a remotely controlled coffeemaker

The plan was to make it turn on remotely on demand, automagically pump water to the tank of the coffeemaker, give
temperature readings from the heating element, automagically lift the lid of the coffeemaker when it's done (40 minute timer)
possibly have a wireless 433Mhz serial connection and make it beep and blink

HTCPCP support would be great, as well as MIB for SNMP. However, this project isn't active anymore, and was only used as a school project in early 2017 while i was learning programming
