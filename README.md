A DIY IoT Coffeemaker

The idea is to gut a Raspberry Pi, some sensors, pumps, motors and other equipment to make a remotely controlled coffeemaker

Currently, the plan is to make it turn on remotely on demand, automagically pump water to the tank of the coffeemaker, give
temperature readings from the heating element, automagically lift the lid of the coffeemaker when it's done (40 minute timer)
possibly have a wireless 433Mhz serial connection and maybe make it beep and blink

I have limited time and resources, the specs list covers what I currently have, as well as a electronics lab at school

HTCPCP support would be great, as well as MIB for SNMP. However, I only started programming 6 months ago with C# being my first language, due to this, implementing HTCPCP and MIB support is postponed for the time being
